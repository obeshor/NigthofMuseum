### NightofMuseum

Night of Museum was created as a part of Udacityâ€™s VR nanodegree program. We were  required to research on a VR company/technology, or an industry that could be impacted by VR. After conducting our research, we decided to create a mobile virtual reality app with 'information booths' which include both visual and audio feedback for users that present the impact of VR in the  Art and culture industry. Here is a brief review of the experience.
